This course will teach you how to create a platform for presenting content like tutorials.

You will be using Microsoft 365 SharePoint as the data store and Power Apps as the tool for presenting to the end users. If you follow the lessons as laid out you'll end up with a fully functioning learning platform. Once you have the core application working you can then expand the functionality as needed by your own organization.

Take aways?

- By using SharePoint, there is no additional licensing
- Entire system is driven by SharePoint lists
- Multiple courses along with multiple users
- Course and lesson completion is tracked between sessions
- Minimal screens used to avoid dreaded flicker
- This is a tablet/desktop app and not intended for mobile phones

I am confident you will find value with the lessons and most likely see many more uses for an app like this.
