        This course will teach you how to create a platform for presenting content like tutorials.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will be using Microsoft 365 SharePoint as the data store and Power Apps as the tool
        for presenting to the end users. If you follow the lessons as laid out you'll end up with a fully functioning
        learning platform. Once you have the core application working you can then expand the
        functionality as needed by your own organization.
